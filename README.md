Project Title: Module 2 Challenge

Description: This repository contains the challenge for our week two bootcamp module, which involed creating a simple portfolio webpage using CSS elements. The website includes a portfolio of upcoming and finished projects, information about me, as well as various ways to contact me. The project involved creating the webpage from scratch, using HTML as well as CSS. Some components that we highlighted in class that I used were, but not limited to:

    -flex boxes
    -media queries
    -class & id selectors
    -font application

This module challenge was a great way to put our learning of HTML and CSS into real practice. I can see myself applying these techniques, etc. outside of class, 100%.

Included in the repository:

    - 1 READ.me file
    - 1 index.html file 
    - 1 style.css sheet, linked to the html file
    - Images folder with 4 images
